# 🚀 AutoCrate

**AutoCrate** is a Rust-powered CLI tool that automates your workflow by creating sequential Rust projects (`gpt1`, `gpt2`, …), initializing git repositories, and opening them directly in your editor.  

Stop wasting time setting up projects — just run one command and start coding.  

---

## ✨ Features  

- 📂 Creates new Rust projects in sequence (`gptN → gptN+1`).  
- ⚡ Initializes local git repo with first commit.  
- 🖥️ Opens project in your preferred editor (default: VS Code).  
- 🛠️ Simple config file to remember your project superfolder.  
- 🔒 Future-proof: GitHub integration, templates, encryption, background mode, and GUI coming soon.

## 📦 Installation  

Clone the repo and build with Cargo:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/autocrate.git
cd autocrate

### 🔨 Compile

Build in **debug mode** (faster, good for testing):

```bash
cargo build
```

Build in **release mode** (optimized, good for daily use):

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Copy the binary to your `$PATH` (Linux example):

```bash
cp target/release/autocrate ~/.local/bin/
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Config is stored at:

```bash
~/.autocrate/config.json
```

Example:

```json
{
  "superfolder": "/home/dev/Projects",
  "editor": "code"
}
```

## 🛣 Roadmap

* [x] Config management (superfolder path).
* [x] Cargo + project creation.
* [x] Local git repo init + commit.
* [x] Open in VS Code.
* [ ] GitHub repo creation + push.
* [ ] Support multiple editors (RustRover, Vim, Helix).
* [ ] Project templates (CLI, GUI, web).
* [ ] Config encryption for GitHub tokens.
* [ ] Background service mode.
* [ ] GUI frontend with project browser.

## 💡 Inspiration

This project was built to automate repetitive project setup and help developers (especially Rust learners) focus more on coding and less on boilerplate.
